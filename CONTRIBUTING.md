The _**catalyst**_ project is maintained by [Curiosity](https://curiosity.ai), and we welcome 
contributors to improve the codebase and flag any issues. This page will give you a quick
overview of how things are organised and most importantly, how to get involved.

## 🐛 Issues and Bugs

First, [do a quick search](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/catalyst/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+)
to see if the issue has already been reported. If so, it's often better to just
leave a comment on an existing issue, rather than creating a new one. Old issues
also often include helpful tips and solutions to common problems.

## 💻 Contributing to the codebase

You don't have to be an NLP expert to contribute, and we're happy
to help you get started. If you're new to _**catalyst**_, a good place to start is the
[Getting Started](https://catalyst.curiosity.ai/getting-started) guide, and the
[`help wanted`](https://github.com/curiosity-ai/catalyst/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
label, which we use to tag bugs and feature requests that are easy and
self-contained. If you've decided to take on one of these problems and you're
making good progress, don't forget to add a quick comment to the issue. You can
also use the issue to ask questions, or share your work in progress.

Remember that _**catalyst**_ is released under the MIT license, so any code you contribute will be made available under the same license.
